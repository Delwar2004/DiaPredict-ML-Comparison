## 📌 Project Overview
Early detection of chronic diseases plays a critical role in reducing long-term health complications. **DiaPredict** is an end-to-end Machine Learning research project that investigates how different classification algorithms perform on real medical diagnostic data (**Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**).

Instead of chasing raw accuracy, this project emphasizes:
* **Model Stability** & **Generalization Ability**
* **Overfitting Detection**
* **Clinical Reliability Analysis**

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
* **🔬 Algorithm Comparison:** Evaluate SVM, Random Forest, KNN, and Logistic Regression.
* **⚖️ Model Generalization:** Identify models that perform consistently on unseen patients.
* **📊 Data Standardization:** Normalize feature distributions using `StandardScaler`.
* **🧠 Reliability Analysis:** Understand which model is safest for real-world prediction.

---

## 🏗️ Technical Pipeline
The project follows a rigorous data science workflow:
`Dataset` → `EDA` → `Preprocessing` → `Standardization` → `Model Training` → `Evaluation` → `Comparison`



1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Feature relationship analysis between Glucose, BMI, and Age.
2. **Preprocessing:** Scaling features to prevent dominance of large numerical values.
3. **Training & Validation:** Split applied to four classifiers trained independently.

## 📊 Experimental Results (Version 4.0 Benchmark)

| Model | Training Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | **77.2%** | **76.6%** | **🏆 Most Stable** |
| **Logistic Regression** | 78.0% | 76.6% | ✅ High Reliability |
| **Random Forest** | 100.0% | 77.9% | ⚠️ Overfitting Detected |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | 83.5% | 74.6% | ⚖️ Moderate Performance |

### 🧠 Critical Insights
* **⚠️ Overfitting Observation:** Random Forest achieved perfect training accuracy (1.0) but showed reduced testing performance, indicating the model memorized patterns.
* **🏆 Generalization Winner:** **SVM** demonstrated minimal performance gap between training and testing, indicating real-world robustness.
* **📌 Key Learning:** In medical AI systems, **Stability > Maximum Accuracy**.
